# Canadian Tire Tracker

Created a tracker that would read the Canadian Tire API for Inventory and make it check every 10 seconds whether or not a store location would have a product. Once a product was found it then send you an email that the item you are looking for is in stock. The only thing you need to add is the link to the product and then the email you would like to recieved the emails on

Benefit to using this is that the feature on the Canadian Tire website was usually wrong or way to slow so by the time you went to purchase the item online it was already out of stock
